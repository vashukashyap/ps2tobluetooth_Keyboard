# ps2tobluetooth_Keyboard
You can use your old ps2 port keyboard wirelessly through bluetooth.

## Things required
Arduino nano
Bluetooth module hc05
5v Battery

## Connections
keyboard vcc ->> arduino nano - 5v  
keyboard ground ->> arduino nano - Gnd  
keyboard data wire ->> arduino nano - A3  
keyboard clock wire ->> arduino nano - A4  

(if you dont know which is color wire is data or clock, google it or an easy way open your keyboard and check it PCB.)

## How to use
1. Flash the  " wireless_keyboard.ino " in your arduino nano.
2. Connect to your bluetooth module hc05 and pair with it.
3. Check the serial transmission port of your buletooth.
